##Roll Dice!

This app was made as a collaborative project at the Iron Yard. It is a dice rolling visualizer that is made with Jquery and styled using tridiv.coms tools to create the 3d cube.

You have the option to roll a 6 sided die, or input a number which would represent the outcome of the roll of a die with as many sides as you want.
